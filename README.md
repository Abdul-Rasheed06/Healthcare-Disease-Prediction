# 🏥 Healthcare Disease Prediction - Kidney Disease Detection

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict **kidney disease** using patient health data. By analyzing various clinical features, the system can assist in early detection of chronic kidney disease, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in timely diagnosis and treatment planning.
